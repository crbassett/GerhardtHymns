## Selected Stanza:
1. Wherefore dost Thou longer tarry  
   Blessed of the Lord afar?  
   Would it were Thy will to enter  
   To my heart, O Thou my Star,  
   Thou my Jesus, Fount of pow'r,  
   Helper in the needful hour!  
   Sharpest wounds my heart is feeling,  
   Touch them, Savior, with Thy healing!  

   Miss Winkworth, 1858.
